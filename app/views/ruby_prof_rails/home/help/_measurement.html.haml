  Depending on the mode and platform, ruby-prof can measure various aspects
  of a Ruby program.  Supported measurements include:
%p
  %b Process Time:
  measures the time used by a process between any two moments.
  It is unaffected by other processes concurrently running on the system.
  Note that Windows does not support measuring process times - therefore,
  measurements on Windows defaults to wall time.
%p
  %b Wall Time:
  measures the real-world time elapsed between any two moments. If
  there are other processes concurrently running on the system that use
  significant CPU or disk time during a profiling run then the reported
  results will be too large.
%p
  %b CPU Time:
  uses the CPU clock counter to measure time.  The returned values
  are dependent on the correctly setting the CPU's frequency. This mode
  is only supported on Pentium or PowerPC platforms (linux only).
%p
  %b Allocation:
  shows how many objects each method in a program
  allocates.  This support was added by Sylvain Joyeux and requires a patched
  Ruby interpreter. See below.
%p
  %b Memory Usage:
  shows how much memory each method in a program uses.
  This support was added by Alexander Dymo and requires a patched Ruby
  interpreter. See below.
%p
  %b Garbage Collection:
  reports how many times Ruby's garbage collector
  is invoked during a profiling session.  This support was added by Jeremy
  Kemper and requires a patched Ruby interpreter. See below.
%p
  %b Garbage Collection Time:
  reports how much time is spent in Ruby's
  garbage collector during a profiling session.  This support was added by
  Jeremy Kemper and requires a patched Ruby interpreter. See below.
