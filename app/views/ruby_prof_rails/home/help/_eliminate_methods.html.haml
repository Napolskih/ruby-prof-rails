%p
  ruby-prof supports eliminating specific methods from profiling
  results. This is useful for reducing connectivity in the call graph, making
  it easier to identify the source of performance problems when using a graph
  printer.
%p
  For example, consider Integer#times: it's hardly ever useful to know
  how much time is spent in the method itself. We're much more interested
  in how much the passed in block contributes to the time spent in the method
  which contains the Integer#times call.
%p
  eliminate_methods is a list of regular expressions (line separated text).
%pre
  :preserve
    Integer#times
    String#.*
%p
  After eliminating methods the resulting profile will appear exactly as if
  those methods had been inlined at their call sites.
